<section id="instrument-resolution">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" role="doc-backlink">Instrument Resolution</a><a class="headerlink" href="#instrument-resolution" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the instrument in a given configuration (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_i = \theta_f, \lambda\)</span>),
each neutron that is received is assigned to a particular <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> based on
the configuration.  However, these vaues are only nominal.  For example,
a monochromator lets in a range of wavelengths, and slits permit a range
of angles.  In effect, the reflectivity measured at the configuration
corresponds to a range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span>.</p>
<p>For monochromatic instruments, the wavelength resolution is fixed and
the angular resolution varies.  For polychromatic instruments, the
wavelength resolution varies and the angular resolution is fixed.
Resolution functions are defined in <a class="reference internal" href="../refl1d.resolution.html#module-refl1d.resolution" title="refl1d.resolution"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">refl1d.resolution</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>The angular resolution is determined by the geometry (slit positions,
openings and sample profile) with perhaps an additional contribution
from sample warp.  For monochromatic instruments, measurements are taken
with fixed slits at low angles until the beam falls completely onto the
sample.  Then as the angle increases, slits are opened to preserve full
illumination.  At some point the slit openings exceed the beam width,
and thus they are left fixed for all angles above this threshold.</p>
<p>When the sample is tiny, stray neutrons miss the sample and are not
reflected onto the detector.  This results in a resolution that is
tighter than expected given the slit openings.  If the sample width
is available, we can use that to determine how much of the beam is
intercepted by the sample, which we then use as an alternative second
slit.  This simple calculation isn’t quite correct for very low <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span>, but
data in this region will be contaminated by the direct beam, so we
won’t be using those points.</p>
<p>When the sample is warped, it may act to either focus or spread the
incident beam.  Some samples are diffuse scatters, which also acts
to spread the beam.  The degree of spread can be estimated from the
full-width at half max (FWHM) of a rocking curve at known slit settings.
The expected FWHM will be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{2}(s_1+s_2)/(d_1-d_2)\)</span>.  The difference
between this and the measured FWHM is the sample_broadening value.
A second order effect is that at low angles the warping will cast
shadows, changing the resolution and intensity in very complex ways.</p>
<p>For time of flight instruments, the wavelength dispersion
is determined by the reduction process which usually bins the time
channels in a way that sets a fixed relative resolution
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta \lambda / \lambda\)</span> for each bin.</p>
<p>Resolution in Q is computed from uncertainty in wavelength <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_\lambda\)</span>
and angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_\theta\)</span> using propagation of errors:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\sigma^2_Q
    &amp;= \left|\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \lambda}\right|^2 \sigma_\lambda^2
     + \left|\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \theta}\right|^2 \sigma_\theta^2
     + 2 \left|\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \lambda}
               \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \theta}\right|^2
               \sigma_{\lambda\theta}
     \\
Q &amp;= 4 \pi \sin(\theta) / \lambda \\
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \lambda} &amp;= -4 \pi \sin(\theta)/\lambda^2
     = -Q/\lambda \\
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \theta} &amp;= 4 \pi \cos(\theta)/\lambda
     = \cos(\theta) \cdot Q/\sin(\theta) = Q/\tan(\theta)\end{split}\]</div>
<p>With no correlation between wavelength dispersion and angular divergence,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{\theta\lambda} = 0\)</span>, yielding the traditional form:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\left(\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}\right)^2
     = \left(\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}\right)^2
     + \left(\frac{\Delta \theta}{\tan(\theta)}\right)^2\]</div>
<p>Computationally, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\tan(\theta) \rightarrow \infty\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta=0\)</span>, so
it is better to use the direct calculation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta Q = 4 \pi/\lambda \sqrt{\sin(\theta)^2 (\Delta\lambda/\lambda)^2
                               + \cos(\theta)^2 \Delta \theta^2}\]</div>
<p>Wavelength dispersion <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta \lambda/\lambda\)</span> is usually constant
(e.g., for AND/R it is 2% FWHM), but it can vary on time-of-flight
instruments depending on how the data is binned.</p>
<p>Angular divergence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta \theta\)</span> comes primarily from the slit geometry,
but can have broadening or focusing due to a warped sample.  The FWHM
divergence in radians due to slits is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\theta_{\rm slits} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{s_1 + s_2}{d_1 - d_2}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_1,s_2\)</span> are slit openings edge to edge and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_1,d_2\)</span> are the distances
between the sample and the slits.  For tiny samples of width <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span>, the sample
itself can act as a slit.  If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = m \sin(\theta)\)</span> is smaller than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_2\)</span> for
some <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>, then use:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\theta_{\rm slits} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{s_1 + m \sin(\theta)}{d_1}\]</div>
<p>The sample broadening can be read off a rocking curve using:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\theta_{\rm sample} = w - \Delta\theta_{\rm slits}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w\)</span> is the measured FWHM of the peak in degrees. Broadening can be
negative for concave samples which have a focusing effect on the beam.  This
constant should be added to the computed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta \theta\)</span> for all angles and
slit geometries.  You will not usually have this information on hand, but
you can leave space for users to enter it if it is available.</p>
<p>FWHM can be converted to 1-<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> resolution using the scale factor of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\sqrt{8 \ln 2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>With opening slits we assume <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta \theta/\theta\)</span> is held constant, so if
you know <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_o\)</span> at the start of the opening slits region you
can compute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta \theta/\theta_o\)</span>, and later scale that to your
particular <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\theta(Q) = \Delta\theta/\theta_o \cdot \theta(Q)\]</div>
<p>Because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> is fixed, that means
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_1(\theta) = s_1(\theta_o) \cdot \theta/\theta_o\)</span> and

<p>By default the calculation points <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_\text{calc}\)</span> are the same
nominal <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> points at which the reflectivity was measured.   If the
data was measured densely enough, then the piece-wise linear function
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar R\)</span> will be a good approximation to the underlying reflectivity.
There are two places in particular where this assumption breaks down.
One is near the critical edge for a sample that has sharp interfaces,
where the reflectivity drops precipitously. The other is in thick
samples, where the Kissig fringes are so close together that the
instrument cannot resolve them separately.</p>
<p>The method <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Probe.critical_edge()</span></code> fills in calculation points
near the critical edge.  Points are added linear around <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_c\)</span> for
a range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm \delta Q_c\)</span>.  Thus, if the backing medium SLD or
the theta offset are allowed to vary a little during the fit, the
region after the critical edge may still be over-sampled.
The method <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Probe.oversample()</span></code> fills in calculation points
around every point, giving each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat R\)</span> a firm basis of support.</p>
<p>While the assumption of Gaussian resolution is reasonable on fixed
wavelength instruments, it is less  so on time of flight instruments,
which have asymmetric wavelength  distributions.  You can explore the
effects of different distributions by subclassing

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" role="doc-backlink">Back reflectivity</a><a class="headerlink" href="#back-reflectivity" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>While reflectivity is usually performed from the sample surface,
there are many instances where them comes instead through the
substrate.  For example, when the sample is soaked in water or
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm D}_2{\rm O}\)</span>, a neutron beam will not penetrate well and
it is better to measure the sample through the substrate.  Rather
than reversing the sample representation, these datasets can
be flagged with the attribute <em>back_reflectivity=True</em>, and the
sample constructed from substrate to surface as usual.</p>
<p>When the beam enters the side of the substrate, there is a
small refractive shift in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> based on the angle of the beam relative
to the side of the substrate. The refracted beam reflects off the
the reversed film then exits the substrate on the other side, with an
opposite refractive shift.  Depending on the absorption coefficient
of the substrate, the beam will be attenuated in the process.</p>
<p>The refractive shift and the reversing of the film are automatically
handled by the underlying reflectivity calculation.  You can even
combine measurements through the sample surface and the substrate
into a single measurement, with negative <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> values representing
the transition from surface to substrate.  This is not uncommon with
magnetic thin film samples.</p>
<p>Usually the absorption effects of the substrate are accounted for
by measuring the incident beam through the same substrate before
normalizing the reflectivity.  There is a slight difference in path
length through the substrate depending on angle, but it is not
significant.  When this is not the case, particularly for measurements
which cross from the surface to substrate in the same scan, an
additional <em>back_absorption</em> parameter can be used to scale the
back reflectivity relative to the surface reflectivity.  There
is an overall <em>intensity</em> parameter which scales both the surface
and the back reflectivity.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" role="doc-backlink">Alignment offset</a><a class="headerlink" href="#alignment-offset" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>It can sometimes be difficult to align the sample, particularly on
X-ray instruments.  Unfortunately, a misaligned sample can lead to
a error in the measured position of the critical edge.  Since the
statistics for the measurement are very good in this region, the
effects on the fit can be large.  By representing the angle directly,
an alignment offset can be incorporated into the reflectivity calculation.
Furthermore, the uncertainty in the alignment can be estimated from
the alignment scans, and this information incorporated directly into
the fit.  Without the theta offset correction you would need to
compensate for the critical edge by allowing the scattering length
density of the substrate to vary during the fit, but this would lead to
incorrectly calculated reflectivity for the remaining points.  For
example, the simulation <a class="reference download internal" download="" href="../_downloads/405aa285c3e8d3937c33925004a4988f/toffset.py"><code class="xref download docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">toffset.py</span></code></a> shows more than 5% error

computes the uncertainty in a alignment from the information in a
rocking curve.  The alignment itself comes from the peak position in
the rocking curve, with uncertainty determined from the uncertainty
in the peak position.  Note that this is not the same as the width
of the peak; the peak stays roughly the same width as statistics are
improved, but the uncertainty in position and width will
decrease.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#daymond2002" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> There is an additional uncertainty in
