1-D reflectometry allows material scientists to understand the structure
of thin films, providing composition and density information as a function
of depth.  With polarized neutron measurements, scientists can study
the sub-surface structure of magnetic samples. The Refl1D modeling program
supports a mixture of slabs, freeform and specialized layer types such as
models for the density distribution of polymer brushes.
